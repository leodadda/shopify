Frequently washing your hands can contribute to this. Ingredients found in sunscreen, lotion, perfume, and cleaning supplies can leave a residue on the diamond, posing potential harm.<br\/><br\/>Whenever you cleanse your hands, ensure you remove your DiamAura ring. However, remember to place it in a secure location. The last thing anyone wants is to discover their ring disappearing down a sink drain or into a waste disposal unit after taking it off to wash their hands.<br\/><br\/>Understand Your Ring's Setting<br\/>Many people are unaware of their ring's specific setting, especially with rings. Understanding this setting provides better insight into its resilience against certain conditions. Some materials might withstand the continuous exposure to chemicals better than others.<br\/><br\/>For example, if your DiamAura ring is set in white gold, the potential for damage extends not only to the diamond but also affects the white gold. This could result in not only a less dazzling ring but also potential damage to the band itself.<\/p>","side_panel_3_page":"care-guide"}},"4fd23485-293f-46a0-8a4c-34d0e25ea41b":{"type":"share","settings":{}}},"block_order":["title","0b3e272b-c86a-4dba-946c-c6912251371c","66924749-9ca3-4717-a3c2-c15334f1a5ae","d021f19b-e7b6-4d23-a68f-eeec83e004d7","f25b9096-d68f-4f31-b0b2-a9a2bae2057f","variant_picker","412945ea-0f7b-4816-9876-513a20d19b04","buy_buttons","95b7e00a-0453-4eb0-9cf0-1dae84d8b822","4fd23485-293f-46a0-8a4c-34d0e25ea41b"],"settings":{"full_width":false,"enable_sticky_info":true,"enable_sticky_add_to_cart":true,"show_taxes_included":true,"media_layout":"collage","display_slider_pagination":true,"media_aspect_ratio":"square","display_captions":false,"hide_variants":true,"lightbox":true,"enable_video_looping":false}},"16623877721f33fb14":{"type":"spacer","settings":{"spacer_mobile":35,"spacer_desktop":90,"border_separator":false,"border_separator_full":false}},"16623743398765981b":{"type":"rich-text","disabled":true,"blocks":{"1662374339c00286b1-1":{"type":"heading","settings":{"text":"RICH TEXT","size":"h3"}},"1662374339c00286b1-2":{"type":"text","settings":{"text":"<p>We understand that creating your custom size can feel daunting.

Bearing the same chemical, physical, and optical characteristics, the key difference boils down to the fact that while natural diamonds are procured through mining, lab-grown diamonds are not.
